# Orchest SDK
Orchest SDK for data passing between pipeline steps in the Orchest platform.

## Basic usage
You can send data and receive data. The destination and source of the data is managed by this
package. For sending all you need to specify is the data you want to send and how to send it. For
receiving all you need to do is call the appropriate receive method depending on where you send the
data to in the previous step.

## Roadmap
We plan to also support other popular programming languages such as R.
