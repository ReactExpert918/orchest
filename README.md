Orchest is a web based data science platform that works on top of your filesystem allowing you to use your
editor of choice. With Orchest you get to focus on visually building and iterating on your
pipeline ideas. Under the hood Orchest runs a collection of containers to provide a scalable platform that can run on your laptop as well as on a large scale cloud cluster.

Orchest lets you
* Interactively build data science pipelines through its visual interface.
* Automatically run your pipelines in parallel.
* Develop your code in your favorite editor. Everything is filesystem based.
* Tag the notebooks cells you want to skip when running a pipeline. Perfect for prototyping as you do not 
  have to maintain a perfectly clean notebook.
