Python package for interacting with [Orchest](https://github.com/orchest/orchest).

## Installation
Note that the Orchest SDK comes pre-installed in Orchest.

Otherwise, the currently recommended method for installing the Orchest SDK is through the `git`
repository using `pip`.

Specifying the branch (in this case `master`) is not strictly necessary. However, it might be useful
to see how it is done to specify a specific branch in case you would want to install a branch other
than `master`.
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/orchest/orchest-sdk.git@master#subdirectory=python
```
