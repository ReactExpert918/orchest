How Orchest works
=================

Orchest is powered by your filesystem. Upon launching, Orchest will
mount a directory called the `userdir`. Its default location is
:code:`orchest/orchest/userdir/`. Inside this directory it will store the following
files `for each pipeline`:

* Your scripts that make up the pipeline, for example :code:`.ipynb` files.
* The Orchest :ref:`SDK` stores step outputs in the :code:`.data` directory to pass data between pipeline steps.
* Logs are stored in :code:`.logs` to show STDOUT output from scripts in the pipeline view.
* An autogenerated `pipeline.json` file that defines the properties of the pipeline and its steps.
  This includes: execution order, names, images, etc. Orchest needs this
  pipeline definition file to work.

Orchest runs as a collection of Docker containers and only stores a global configuration file. The
location for this config is :code:`~/.config/orchest/config.json` for Unix based systems and
:code:`%UserProfile%\.orchest\config.json` for Windows.
