Orchest
=======

.. tip::
   ðŸ‘‰ Get started with the :ref:`quickstart <quickstart>`!

Orchest is a tool for building data pipelines, made to be easy to use.

A pipeline in Orchest can be thought of as a graph, where the nodes are executable files that
execute within their own
isolated environment (powered by containerization), and the edges/connections define the way the data flows. All defined through our visual pipeline editor.

After coding your Notebooks and scripts, Orchest let's you run any subset of the pipeline either
interactively or on a cron-like schedule.

.. note::
   Orchest is in alpha.
