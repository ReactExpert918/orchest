Orchest SDK for data passing between pipeline steps in the Orchest platform. The SDK manages the
destination and source of the data, leaving the user only with the decision what data to send
(because receiving automatically retrieves all the sent data).

The destination and source of the data are inferred through the defined pipeline definition in the
platform (the ``pipeline.json`` file).
