Passing data between pipeline steps
===================================

To pass data between the different pipeline steps, across different languages, we make use of the
`Apache Arrow <https://github.com/apache/arrow>`_ project. The :ref:`Orchest SDK` provides a
convenience wrapper of the project to be used within Orchest.

See :ref:`sdk-quickstart-data-passing` to get started directly.
