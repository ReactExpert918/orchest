Quickstart
==========

General workflow in Orchest
---------------------------

1. Build your pipeline. Visually build your pipeline: create, drag and connect steps.

2. Write your code. Use your editor of choice or use the integrated JupyterLab environment in
   Orchest.

3. Run your pipeline. Happy with your implementation? Go back to the pipeline view and run your
   pipeline.

4. Check your output (either inside your notebook or the logs view for scripts).


Your first project
------------------
You can follow the next example.

Launch Orchest:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./orchest.sh start

Build your pipeline. Create two steps and connect them.
