Quickstart
==========


General workflow in Orchest
---------------------------

1. Visually build your pipeline. Drag, drop and connect steps.

2. Click on one of the steps to open your editor of choice.

3. Implement your step, e.g. load and preprocess your data.

4. Once you are happy with your implementation. Go back to the pipeline view and run a part of your
   pipeline.

5. Check your output (either inside your notebook or the logs view for scripts).

6. Reiterate on your implementation and go back to step 4.
