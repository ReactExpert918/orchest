Quickstart
==========

General workflow in Orchest
---------------------------

1. Build your pipeline. Visually build your pipeline: create, drag and connect steps.

2. Write your code. Use your editor of choice or use the integrated JupyterLab environment in
   Orchest.

3. Run your pipeline. Happy with your implementation? Go back to the pipeline view and run your
   pipeline.

4. Check your output (either inside your notebook or the logs view for scripts).


Your first project
------------------
You can follow the next example.

Launch:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -v <mount>:<mount> installer

Write your code. Add the following code in the first step (Click on the step > open notebook)
Add the following code in the second step (You can use the JupyterLab interface to open the file).
You can read more about the orchest sdk here in the docs (INSERT LINK)
(INSERT GIF that opens the jupyterlab that has the code inside). Possibly also where there is a
"skip" tag.
