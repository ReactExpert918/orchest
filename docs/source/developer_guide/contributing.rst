help or would like our perspective, then don't hesitate and reach out to us on our `Slack

Opening a PR
------------

.. note::
   When opening a PR please change the base in which you want to merge from ``master`` to ``dev``.
   The `GitHub docs
   <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request>`_
   describe how this can be done.

We use `gitflow <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow>`_ as
our branching model with ``master`` and ``dev`` being the described ``master`` and ``develop``
branches respectively. Therefore, we require PRs to be merged into ``dev`` instead of ``master``.

When opening the PR a checklist will automatically appear to guide you to successfully complete your
PR 🏁.

Contributor License Agreement
-----------------------------

Our CLA is an exact copy of the Apache CLA (apart from the names), which the cla-assistant will
automatically prompt you to sign when creating a pull request. Signing is done electronically.

The CLA ensures that Orchest has clear ownership specification for all contributions, which in
turns lets us guarantee to users that we have no "stray" intellectual property or
differently-licensed material.
