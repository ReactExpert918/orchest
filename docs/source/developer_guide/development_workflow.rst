Development workflow
====================

.. _prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------
In order to code on Orchest, you need to have the following installed on your system:

* `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_
* `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/#installation>`_
* `npm <https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm>`_ and `pnpm
  <https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm>`_
* Python version ``3.x``

Next, you will need to setup your development environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Make sure you are inside the orchest root directory.
   npm run setup --install && \
       pnpm i && \
       python3 -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt && \
       pre-commit install

Last but not least, Orchest needs to be build from source:

.. code-block:: bash

   scripts/build_container.sh

.. note::
   ðŸŽ‰ Awesome! Everything is set up now and you are ready to start coding. Have a look at our
   `GitHub <https://github.com/orchest/orchest/issues>`_ and find interesting issues to work on.

IDE & language servers
----------------------
Who doesn't like to use the smarts of their IDE by using features such as auto complete, go to
definition, find all references etc. For everyone who is using VS Code (or the `pyright
<https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_ language server to be more precise) the different services
contain their own ``pyrightconfig.json`` file that configures these features. All that is needed is
to install the dependencies of the services in the correct virtual environment. This is done using:

.. code-block:: bash

   scripts/run_tests.sh

Incremental development
-----------------------
.. note::
   For incremental development to work in WSL2, Docker must be installed within the WSL2
   environment itself.

Now that you have Orchest and all dev dependencies installed it is ready to start Orchest in dev
mode by using the ``--dev`` flag. This way code changes that are instantly reflected, without having
to build the containers again.

.. code-block:: bash

   # In case any new dependencies were changed or added they need to
   # be installed.
   pnpm i

   # Run the client dev server for hot reloading. Note: This command
   # does not finish.
   pnpm run dev

   # Start Orchest in a new terminal window.
   ./orchest start --dev

With ``--dev`` the repository code from the filesystem is mounted (and thus adhering to git
branches) to the appropriate paths in the Docker containers. This allows for active code changes
being reflected inside the application.

A few additional notes about running Orchest with the ``--dev`` flag:

* All Flask applications are run in development mode.
* Only the ``orchest-webserver``, ``auth-server``, ``file-manager`` and ``orchest-api`` support code
  changes to be instantly reflected. For code changes to other services you will have to rebuild the
  container and restart Orchest.

Building the docs
-----------------

Our docs are build using `Read the Docs <https://docs.readthedocs.io/>`_ with Sphinx and written in
`reStructuredText`.

To build the docs, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd docs
   make html

Before committing
-----------------

Make sure your development environment is set up correctly (see :ref:`prerequisites
<prerequisites>`) so that pre-commit can automatically take care of running the appropriate
formatters and linters when running ``git commit``. Lastly, it is good practice to run the units
tests to make sure your changes didn't break anything:

.. code-block:: bash

    scripts/run_tests.sh

In our CI we also run all of these checks together with integration tests to make sure the codebase
remains stable. To read more about testing, check out the :ref:`tests <tests>` section.
