Quickstart
==========

.. TODO
   We have decided to make this into a tutorial with pictures instead of gifs. It should follow an
   example (that the user can import from GitHub) and explain some of the core concepts of Orchest.

General workflow in Orchest
---------------------------

1. *Build your pipeline*. Visually build your pipeline: create, drag and connect steps.

2. *Write your code*. Use your editor of choice or use the integrated JupyterLab environment in
   Orchest.

3. *Run your pipeline*. Happy with your implementation? Go back to the pipeline view and run your
   pipeline.

4. *Check your output*. This can be done either through the "logs" view or directly inside your
   notebook.


Your first project
------------------
We will go through an example project showing you how to build a pipeline in Orchest.

Launch Orchest:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./orchest start

Build your pipeline. Create two steps and connect them.

Directly edit your pipeline steps.

Run your pipeline and see the results come in.
