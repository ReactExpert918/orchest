Contributer guides
==================

Contributor License Agreement
-----------------------------

TBD.

The CLA ensures that Orchest has clear ownership specification for all contributions, which in
turns lets us guarantee to users that we have no "stray" intellectual property or
differently-licensed material.


Development environment
-----------------------
To start hacking on Orchest clone the repo from GitHub. You can find useful scripts for development
in the :code:`dev-utils` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/orchest/orchest.git
