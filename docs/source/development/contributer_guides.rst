Contributer guides
==================

Contributor License Agreement
-----------------------------
.. Deze heb ik van Django gejat

The CLA ensures that Orchest has clear license to all its contributions, which in turns lets us
guarantee to users that we have no "stray" intellectual property or differently-licensed material.


Development environment
-----------------------
To get up and running all you have to do is run the Orchest installer and mound the repository code
as such: 

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -v <mount>:<mount> installer
